Problem Statement: Predicting CO Concentration in the Air using Gas Sensor Data

Background:
Our company is a leading manufacturer of gas sensors, and we are focused on developing advanced solutions for monitoring air quality. One of the key gases of interest 
is carbon monoxide (CO), which is a highly toxic gas that can have severe health implications if present in high concentrations. We want to leverage the power of 
data science and machine learning to build accurate models that can predict CO concentration in the air based on gas sensor data.

Problem Statement:
The objective of this datathon is to develop predictive models that accurately estimate the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the air using gas sensor data. 
Participants are expected to address the following challenges:

1. Preprocessing:
Gas sensor data can be noisy and subject to variations due to environmental factors and other sources of interference. 
Participants should develop effective strategies for preprocessing the data to ensure its quality and reliability.

2. Model Development and Selection:
Participants should build machine learning models capable of predicting CO concentration accurately. 
Various approaches, such as regression models, time series models, or ensemble methods, can be explored. 
The models should be evaluated using appropriate performance metrics and compared to identify the most effective approach.

3. Model Interpretability:
While accuracy is essential, it is also crucial to understand the factors influencing the CO concentration predictions. 
Participants should strive to develop models that provide interpretable insights, allowing users to understand the contributions of different features or sensors to the predicted
 CO concentration.

Expected Deliverables:
Participants should aim to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating CO concentration in the air based on gas sensor data. 
The deliverables should include well-documented code, detailed explanations of the models used, and an evaluation of the model's performance, 
including metrics such as mean squared error and R2 score.

Evaluation Criteria:
Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Prediction Accuracy (70% Round 2): The proposed models should demonstrate high accuracy in predicting CO concentration, as measured by appropriate evaluation metrics.

2. Model Interpretability (15% Round 2): The extent to which the models provide interpretable insights into the factors influencing the CO concentration predictions will be considered.

3. Documentation and Presentation (15% Round 1): The clarity of the documentation, including code structure, feature engineering techniques, model selection, and evaluation results, 
will be assessed.
