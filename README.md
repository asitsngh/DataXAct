# DataXAct

## Proposed solution:
_Preprocessing:_

<p>1. Merge common columns:<br/>
<ul>Merging combines information from multiple datasets into a single dataset. <br/>
It is performed based on common columns or keys present in both datasets.<br/>
Merging allows consolidation of data and creation of a unified dataset for analysis or modeling<br/></ul>
2. Drop rows with missing target values:<br/>
<ul>Missing target values hinder accurate analysis or model training.<br/>
Dropping rows with missing target values ensures a clean dataset.<br/>
It guarantees the availability of complete information for model training or analysis.<br/></ul>
3. Use Imputer to Replace Feature Values:<br/>
<ul>Imputation fills in missing values in features or input variables.<br/>
Missing values can occur due to data collection errors or incomplete records.<br/>
Imputation ensures the dataset is complete and usable for model training.<br/>
Common techniques include mean imputation, median imputation, or using advanced methods like regression or machine learning algorithms for prediction.<br/></ul></p>
